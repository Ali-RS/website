                AppStates are the building blocks for your application. They help you separate your application into logical parts and can be used to quickly extend the base application. They can also be reused in other applications so you will quickly
                build your own library of AppStates and integrate publically available extensions easily into your application.

                jME3 comes with a wide array of special effects, primarily through the use of post processor filters and particle emitters. These are the “smoke and mirrors” tricks that allow you to emulate the wondrous stuff of nature, such as water,
                fog, light scattering and of course, explosions.
